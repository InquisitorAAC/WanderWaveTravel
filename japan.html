    <h3>Currency Exchange</h3>

    <p class="japanttaa">The currency used in Japan is the Japanese Yen (JPY). Currency exchange services are widely available at airports, banks, post offices, and currency exchange counters in major cities. It's advisable to compare exchange rates and fees to get the best deal.</p>

    <h3>Language Phrases</h3>

    <p class="japanttaa">Japan is generally a safe destination for travellers, with low crime rates and excellent infrastructure. However, it's essential to take common-sense precautions to ensure a smooth and enjoyable trip. Keep your belongings secure in crowded areas, beware of pickpockets, and be cautious when crossing streets, especially in busy cities.</p>

    <h3>Packing Essentials:</h3>

    <p class="japanttaa">When packing for your trip to Japan, consider the season and activities you'll be engaging in. Essentials include comfortable walking shoes for exploring, lightweight and breathable clothing (layers are recommended), a travel adapter for charging electronic devices, a portable Wi-Fi device or SIM card for internet access, and a compact umbrella or raincoat for unexpected showers.</p>

    <h3>Local Customs and Traditions:</h3>

    <p class="japanttaa">Respect cultural traditions and customs, especially when visiting temples, shrines, and other sacred sites. Remove your shoes before entering tatami-mat rooms or certain establishments, and refrain from pointing or touching artifacts.
